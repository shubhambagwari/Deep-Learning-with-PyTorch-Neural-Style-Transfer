# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch-Neural-Style-Transfer

Neural Style Transfer is a technique to apply stylistic features of a Style image onto a Content image while retaining the Content's overall structure and complex features. We will see how to create content and style models, compute content and style costs and ultimately run a training loop to optimize a proposed image which retains content features while imparting stylistic features from another image.

### Introduction

1. Import the Model
2. Import Libraries and Helper Functions
3. Image Preprocessing and Display
4. Content and Style Models
5. Compute Content Cost
6. Define Gram Matrix
7. Compute Style Cost
8. Training Loop
9. Plot the Results
