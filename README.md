# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch-Neural-Style-Transfer

Neural Style Transfer is an optimization technique used to take a content and a style image and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image but painted in the style of the style image. We will create artistic style image using content and given style image. We will compute the content and style loss function. We will minimize this loss function using optimization techniques to get an artistic style image that retains content features and style features.

### Introduction

1. Set google colab runtime
2. Loading VGG-19 pretrained model
3. Preprocess Image
4. Deprocess Image
5. Create content and style loss 
6. Get content,style features and create gram matrix
7. Training loop
